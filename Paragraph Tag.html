		<p> A rainy day is a day in which it rains all day long. In our country, a rainy 		day is a common scene. It is a dull and gloomy day and the sky is overcast with 		black clouds. </p>

		<p> On this day everybody is to face trouble to go out because it rains 		continuously and the roads become muddy and slippery. The out-goers have to go 		out with an umbrella over the head, shoes in hand and clothes folded up to the 		knee. </p>
		
		<p> A rainy day is a happy day for the students. The classes are not held and 				they can enjoy themselves. There a rainy day is a boon as well as a curse to 		people. </p>
