		<p align = "justify"> A rainy day is a day in which it rains all day long. In 		our country, a rainy day is a common scene. It is a dull and gloomy day and 		the sky is overcast with black clouds.On this day everybody is to face trouble 		to go out because it rains continuously and the roads become muddy and 		slippery. The out-goers have to go out with an umbrella over the head, shoes 		in hand and clothes folded up to the knee.  If it so happens that it rains all 		day long, we call it a rainy day. In such a day, the sky remains cloudy. The 		sun is not seen at all. The day looks dull and gloomy. Sometimes it rains 		heavily and sometimes it drizzles. Often there are flashes of lightning and 		roars of thunder in the sky. Birds are hardly seen to fly. They keep standing 		on the branches of trees. Cattle keep standing on their sheds. In such a day, 		people have to remain indoors. The roads become almost muddy and desolate. One 		cannot mob easily from one place to another. One does not generally come out 		without compulsion. The poor suffer much. They cannot go out to earn their 		daily bread. It is a great joy for the students. Because classes are not held 		on such a day. Some people than spend time gossiping, playing cards, singing 		or hearing songs. After all, a rainy day gives us both joy and sorrow. It 		comes to different classes of people in different ways. I feel delighted in 		such a day. </p>
