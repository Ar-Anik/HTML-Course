            <p> 
                Rainy day comes as a musical surprise for all, 
                bringing a luscious climate and chilling weather. 
                Dark clouds shower water droplets over the earth 
                underneath them. The climate becomes pleasant â€“ 
                not too cold, neither too hot on a rainy day.
                A rainy day cleans the flora on land and makes 
                everything look new and fresh; as a result, the 
                greenery around us reveals its lush green colour. 
                A rainy day is also suitable for irrigation and 
                increasing the yield, and also for opening up the 
                prospects of conserving rainwater for the future, 
                for it helps to refill the natural water bodies of earth.
